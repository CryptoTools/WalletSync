  WalletSync, by zelles

  Sync/Backup your crypto-currency wallets

  This program will sync any wallet.dat files found in their
  default location, AppData/Roaming/*/wallet.dat... The program
  will make a copy of all the wallets in the SyncData folder
  found in the script directory where WalletSync is run.

  The sync runs once every minute and can be minimized to the system
  tray to constantly stay syncing, a backup, in the background.

  The next version will have the option to send the wallet.dat files
  to a FTP server or email address.
